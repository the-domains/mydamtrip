Traveling to Thailand was an eye opening experience. Seeing the huge differences in cultures between the US and Thailand but I did learn, quite quickly, certain things that should be avoided.

1.) Un-metered Taxis.

You are almost always guaranteed to get ripped off as a traveler. This only happened to me once though. Coming out of Don Meaung airport for the first time I did not know that you are supposed to take a ticket to get a taxi. In fact there is a huge taxi stand with gates and all that you are supposed to go through...anyway.

I negotiated something like 300 THB to go to the BTS. Only we didn't go to the BTS station I asked for which added an additional 30 minutes to my travels.

2.) Soi Dogs.

On your research about Thailand you may have come across talk of wild dogs running around. This is true, there are dogs everywhere. During the day they aren't bad, it's at night that you have to be careful. Especially past 9pm. The wild Soi Dogs will bark and nip at your heels. 

Funny side story, I met a Scotsman in Phuket who was there training the wild Soi Dogs. He was a sheep herder as well. Said he couldn't stay because the job didn't pay. 

Best advise when coming in contact with Soi Dogs in Thailand is to keep walking and don't make eye contact. Do not look back at them and do not run, just walk confidently away. It you see them on the sidewalk ahead, cross the street if possible. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7dea120a-e507-47f8-96ef-f775f1bdef5a.jpg)

3.) Thinking All Thai Women are Prostitutes.

This is not true. There aren't even bars with prostitutes outside of certain areas. There are Bar Girls at the bar but they aren't prostitutes. Bar Girls are there to keep your beer full, order food and make jokes with you. Almost like a super waitress but they don't leave with you.

Getting around the city (Bangkok) I found that being around women was no different than being in the US. In no way did I walk around and experience women touching me or treating me any different. Unless they were calling me a "Farang". (pronounced Fah-Laang)

4.) Tabs in Cups at Bars.

This is usually a scam. They will add drinks to your tab ... especially if you are buying one of the bar girls a drink. Double especially if you buy the bartender a drink. I'm assuming the staff is thinking that you will forget how many drinks you bought. 

How to avoid this. Pay for every drink as you get it and if the bartender hands you a ticket or puts one in a cup in front of you let her know that you want to pay for every drink as you are served. 

ProTip: The Bar Girls aren't really drinking. Most of the time they are non-alcoholic drinks.

5.) Fear.

Above all the number one, or 5 in this case is fear. Don't be afraid of Soi Dogs, or Bar Girls, or Tab Cups. Go with your gut feeling when you travel anywhere. Always take safety precautions and have backup plans, but don't be afraid when you are traveling. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3c9e2aff-356b-4afc-b851-78552eba4239.jpg)

5.1.) Bad Choices.

Anything that would make your best friend say "Dude you asked for it."
